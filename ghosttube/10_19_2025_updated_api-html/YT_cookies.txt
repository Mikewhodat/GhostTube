this is temporary. Obviously I'm not going to ship one of my cookies connected to even one of my throwaway. Email accounts.

if you're wondering how to acquire this, go to the extension manager in Firefox and download cookies.txt from your own account again, this is optional.

and unless you want to go through the fast-API and change the name variable match the variable. from your cookies.txt to --> YT_cookies.txt.

again, optional, you will get better results and less rejections. I would not recommend using your primary email.
